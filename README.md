# Deep_Learning_CV

Any details are clearly submitted in the python notebook. 
This is a group assignement for the course Computer Vision of KUL engineering department. 

Major objects of the assignment are: 
- CNN
- Semantic Segmentatation
- Deep Learning
- Image Classification
- Adversarial Attack

PASCAL VOC 2009 was used as a dataset for this assignement.
As an aftermath, deep knowledge and undersatnding was gained for such important features of computer vision and deep learning in general. 

The code is not my property. This is a group assignement where details about all 4 members of the team are stated in the notebook. 
Warm regards,
